# HackSheffield Website

## Contribution
The website is managed by Danny and additionally the rest of the Committee.

## Branches
`master` is the default branch. This is the production branch, with any changes being committed going live immediately. _(Github updated pages!)_

Any non-minor change to the website should be made to a new _feature branch_ (eg. `add-video-header`), and then merged into `master` when ready using a _pull request_.

### New websites
When creating a new website (eg. for the next season while the current website is still live), it should have it's own repository. This repository should only be for this hackathon.
