#HackSheffield Website
##Contribution
The website is managed by Danny and additionally the rest of the Committee.
##Branches
*gh-pages* is the default branch. This is the production branch, with any changes being committed going live immediately.

Each iteration of the website for the respective hackathon season should be modified on it's own branch according to year and season. (e.g. 2016f for Fall 2016 Season).
