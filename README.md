# HackSheffield Website

This was the repository for HackSheffield 2.0 in Autumn 2016. It also hosted the HackSheffield 3.0 website for some time on the `2017f` branch.

## Contribution

The website was managed by Danny and additionally the rest of the Committee, however this website should no longer be modified.

## Branches

`master` is the default branch. This is the production branch, with any changes being committed going live immediately. _(Github updated pages!)_

Any non-minor change to the website should be made to a new _feature branch_ (eg. `add-video-header`), and then merged into `master` when ready using a _pull request_.
